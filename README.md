<h1>How to run</h1>
<p>Just open the ipynb file in google colab and Ctrl F9 to run all the code</p>

<h1>Publication</h1>
<p>We use this project to have the publication in RIVF 2021 conference. For more about the methods or the implementation of the project you can read the paper with information below. (DOI is only available in March 2022)</p>

 <h1>NOTICE</h1>
 <p>In Janary 9 2023, I known that Google Colab had suspended the Tensorflow 1.x. So the baseline on Colab file is not running anyways. To run this, you can use command in the baseline to deploy on other place (I recommend you to use Docker). Or you can update the whole codes to transform from tensorflow 1 to tensorflow 2. If you want to have any contributed, you can make an request and I will appreciate if you do that<p>
 
 <p>Feel free to clone my code and I will appreciate if you improve it</p>
